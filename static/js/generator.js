I then comb my hair. Yes, I do use a comb. Do I comb it forward? No, I don\'t comb it forward. I actually don\'t have a bad hairline. When you think about it, it\'s not bad. I mean, I get a lot of credit for comb-overs. But it's not really a comb-over. It\'s sort of a little bit forward and back. I\'ve combed it the same way for years. Same thing, every time."
